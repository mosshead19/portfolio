    <p>
        Adobong Sitaw, also known as String Bean Adobo, is a popular Filipino dish. It combines tender string beans with a savory and tangy sauce made from soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and onion. Sometimes pork belly is added for extra flavor and richness. This dish is typically simmered until the beans are tender and the sauce is slightly reduced, making it a perfect accompaniment to steamed rice. üçõ</p>
